# todo_app_flutter

This is a project management / to-do app.
It is a very simple project but the main goal of this project was to explore the design possibilies.
I started this app while I was doing my flutter course, put it on ice and recently got back to it. Changed the cocept a list as it was a signle page to-do page. Now allowing the user to create projects and link tasks to each project.

## Getting Started

This app comes with boiler plate projects and tasks to show the user how the app looks on-load. The data of the app does not currently persist. So a possible future itteration could see the use of firebase or sqflite.
